# csound-vim
### Csound tools for Vim

Set of tools for editing Csound files (`.orc`, `.sco`, `.csd`, `.udo`) with Vim: syntax recognition and highlighting, folding, macros, autocompletion, on-line reference, and templates.


### Installation
##### with a plugin manager

`csound-vim` is compatible with [pathogen] (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). If you have it installed, you can install the plugin the usual way:

    cd $HOME/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/luisjure/csound/

To update, simply run `git pull` in the `bundle/csound` directory:

    cd $HOME/.vim/bundle/csound
    git pull

You should be able install just as easily using other plugin managers, like Vundle, NeoBundle, or VimPlug.

##### manual installation

Download the plugin as a `.zip` file, and extract all the directories (`doc`, `ftdetect`, `macros`, `syntax` and `templates`) in `$HOME/.vim/` for a local installation, or in `$VIM/vimfiles` for a system installation.

After installation, run in Vim `:helptags` on the directory with the documentation to generate the local tags for Vim's online help system. In a system installation, the command must be run as `root`.

### Features
##### syntax highlighting
Highlighting of all (or most) Csound syntactic elements. List of `opcodes` updated to Csound 6.07.

##### folding
The [folding] (http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_28.html) function in Vim is used to fold orchestra and score sections, instruments and user defined opcodes, multiline comments, etc.

##### macros
Some function keys are mapped to macros to save the `.csd` file, compile it and listen to the results, without leaving the editor.

- ` F8` - write current `.csd` to disk, compile it without extra command line flags
- ` F9` - write current `.csd` to disk, compile it and send to audio card in realtime (`-o dac`)
- `F10` - write current `.csd` to disk, compile it and write it to file `./filename.wav`, convert it to mp3, return to Vim
- `F11` - write current `.csd` to disk, compile it and write it to file `./filename.wav`, stay in console (for debugging)
- `F12` - play (with the command `aplay`) last compiled file, return to Vim 

These macros were designed for GNU/Linux, they might need adjustments for other environments.

##### template
When creating a new file with the `.csd` extension, the `templates/template.csd` file will be used as a template.

##### autocompletion
A dictionary is included with all the valid `opcode` names in the language, to be used with the built-in autocompletion function in Vim.
In insert or replace mode, type a few letters and then press `Ctrl-n` or `Ctrl-p`; a menu will appear with all the possible completions.
See [`:he ins-completion`] (http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/insert.html#ins-completion) for more details.

##### online help
Online documentation for most Csound elements is available through the `:he[lp]` command, or typing `K` when the cursor is on the element in normal mode. See [`:he help`] (http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/helphelp.html) and [`:he K`] (http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/various.html#K) for more details. 

The help file is based on an abridged version of the Csound html manual, updated to version 6.07.

##### html manual
In normal mode, the `F1` key opens in the default web browser the manual page for the opcode under the cursor.

The global variable `g:csound_manual` can be defined in `.vimrc`, pointing to a local directory with the html manual.

If this variable is not defined, the web version at `csound.github.io` will be opened.

##### example `csd`
In normal mode, the `F2` key opens in a new tab the example `csd` for the opcode under the cursor, if it exists and its name is of the form `opcode.csd`.

This only works if the global variable `g:csound_manual` is defined and points to a local copy of the html manual.
